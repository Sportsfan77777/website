        <h2>REUs</h2>

        <p><b><u>Advice for applying to REUs</b></u></p>

        <p>How to apply for an REU program: (<a href="https://astrobites.org/2013/01/05/so-you-want-to-apply-for-an-reu-heres-how/" target="_blank">via Astrobites</a>)</p>

        <p>Note that:</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(1) Most deadlines are in February. But some are later! And some are earlier!! Nearly all programs require 1 or 2 recommendation letters. For most programs, it is a good idea (and a safe idea) to ask for recommendation letters in early to mid December. Once you have figured out where you want to apply, it is nice to send your recommenders an organized list of where you are applying. </p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(2) REUs (in the US) are intended to give students (ideally, future astro grad students) research opportunities, in particular those students who do not have many research opportunities at their home institutions. If you are at a university with few or no astronomy research opportunities, emphasize this! If you are at a good astronomy research university, this can still help you IFF you want to do research in a sub-field that your university does not have (if so, emphasize this!).</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(3) REUs (in the US) are intended to promote diversity. If you are female and/or an underrepresented minority, you should have a much better chance at getting an REU than someone who does not fall into those categories.</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(4) REUs are mostly targeted at sophomores and juniors. Even if you are a sopohomore and a good candidate, you may get passed over in favor of a junior applicant since it will be the last chance for that junior to participate in an REU.</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(5) There are many more qualified students than REU spots. Unlike with grad school, you cannot just apply to more and more programs that are worse and worse until you eventually get in somewhere. Also, if you have summer research opportunities at your university, depending on how "bad" the REU program is, you might just prefer to stay at your university anyway.</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(6) There are no application fees! So, you can apply to as many REUs as you want! However, you should spend time on each individual application. Specifically, you should make sure each application is tailored to the specific program (probably in terms of the research opportunities and the professors/researchers that you would want to work with). On average, students interested in REUs tend to apply to anywhere from 5 to 12 programs, with a median of 9 or 10. This should get you 0, 1, or 2 offers, in most cases.</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(7) It is a good idea to have research experience before you apply to an REU. This will give you someone to write a recommendation letter. (This is why it is difficult to get an REU as a freshman.) If you do not already have research experience, it is still possible to get an REU, but you will need luck on your side.</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(8) For eligibility, most programs require that you have not graduated yet. For REUs in the US, you often have to be a US student (or green card holder?). Thus, international students are often not eligible. If you are an international student looking for a summer program, try looking anywhere that is not the US. These programs do exist! They are not all organized by one organization (like with the NSF in the US), so they are harder to find. But they are out there!</p>

        <p style="font-size:11px">(9) REU applications are excellent practice for grad school applications (and also fellowship applications). If you applied for REUs at some point as an undergrad, you should be excellent shape for writing that personal statement for grad school.</p>
