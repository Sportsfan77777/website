        <p>An REU program is a "Research Experience for Undergraduates" program that offers several research positions (usually, for an 8 to 10 week period during the summer). Many REU programs are run by the NSF (National Science Foundation). However on this page, the term "REU" will refer to any external summer program that consists of a group of students doing research, regardless of whether the program officially calls itself an REU or not. </p>

        <h3>Why participate in an REU?</h3>

        There are several advantages of participating in an REU program. 
        You get exposure to another physics (or astro) department.
        You get to meet new physicists (or astrophysicists) who are not at Cornell. If you stay in physics (and especially if you stay in astrophysics), you will see these people again.
        You might get the chance to conduct research in a different field. There is a wide variety of research in physics (and astro). Not all of it is conducted at Cornell. Maybe, you are interested in research that is not conducted here, but is conducted at a place with a physics (or astro) REU program.
        You get to meet other physics (and/or astro) undergrads! Cornell is not the only place with cool undergrads studying physics. Students participating in REUs often represent a much wider, more diverse set of backgrounds. Chances are you will meet someone totally different from any physics major you know at Cornell (for better or worse ;-).
        You get to explore a new city. If you are in an REU not at Cornell, this is an opportunity to live somewhere else (whether it is in a different part of the country, or maybe even a different country).
        You get paid more. Most NSF-sponsored REUs offer stipends of ~$5000 plus housing and travel included. I believe this is about twice as much as most Cornell professors pay their undergrads over the summer.

        You get the opportunity to attend a conference. Most NSF-sponsored REUs will also cover the cost to present your summer research at a conference. This is good practice for presenting your work (which you will do throughout your career, whether you stay in physics or not), but more importantly, this is an unbelievably fantastic networking opportunity.
        Who knows? Maybe someone will want to collaborate with you or offer you a job for next summer? Or you will get the chance to talk to someone on one of your graduate school admissions committees?

        Your summer advisor is another person to write a recommendation letter for you for graduate school. If summer research goes even slightly well, your advisor will end up being one of your recommenders. 
        When you apply to graduate school, you need 3 recommenders (preferably, 2 out of 3 or even 3 out of 3 should be research advisors with whom you have done good quality research). If you already have a research advisor at Cornell, your summer advisor is already #2.

        Some (but not all) graduate programs favor students who participated in their REU program and had a productive summer in the program.
