        <p>I study the formation and evolution of planets and other objects in planetary systems</p>

        <p>I just arrived at Steward, so I am not involved in anything here yet.</p>
        <p>While I was an undergraduate at Cornell, I primarily worked in two research groups led by Professors Dong Lai and Gordon Stacey. 
          <br>I also participated in two summer programs where I became a member of both the CASTLE group (Computation ASTrophysics at LEiden) led by Professor Simon Portegies Zwart and the SAO Solar Physics group where I worked with Dr. Kamen Kozarev.</p>

        <p>To become a scientist, one must train heavily in the arts of math and science. 
          <br>Mastery of these arts can lead to a career in math or science. Interestingly, this mastery can also drive you to success in a lot of other walks of life.</p>

        <p>Math is about logic, critical thinking, and problem solving (It's not about numbers!) -- skills that are not only useful, but essential in any career path.
          <br>Physics teaches you to appreciate different scales and sizes, which is great for recognizing when a number is big or small (check the units!) or reconciling your short-term goals with your long-term goals.</p>

        <p>As a scientist, I hope to work with others to teach what I have learned to any type of student. Also, I hope to find people who are excited by and want to learn more about science and astronomy, not just because it is cool (Though, it is cool!), but because of the life lessons they carry along the way.</p>
